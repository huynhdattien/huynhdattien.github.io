I am a Ph.D. candidate (5th year) in Economics at the University of Nevada Reno.

My interest in economics was sparked when I was participating in a medical trip in the highland mountain of Vietnam in Summer 2013. Since then, my quest for answers has brought me to Economics and its applications, especially in public policy and development economics.  

Before joining the University of Nevada Reno in 2018, I worked as a research assistant intern at the Northwest Energy and Conservation Council, and a data analyst intern at Living Cully in Portland, Oregon, helping to analyze data and find sustainable solutions for energy consumption for Portland's households. The Living Cully Energy Plan is available [here](https://www.livingcully.org/incoming/2018/05/LC-Community-Energy-Plan-FINAL-6.pdf).

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews.
